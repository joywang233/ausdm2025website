# Welcome to AusDM 2024

The Australasian Data Science and Machine Learning Conference formerly known as the Australasian Data Mining Conference has established itself as the premier Australasian meeting for both practitioners and researchers in Data Science including but not limited to Data Analytics and Data Mining theory and applications and Machine Learning including but not limited Deep Learning and Generative AI. It is devoted to the art and science of intelligent learning and analysis of (usually big) data sets for meaningful (and previously unknown) insights. This conference will enable the sharing and learning of research and progress in the local context and new breakthroughs in Data Science and Machine Learning algorithms and their applications across all industries.

Since AusDM’02 the conference has showcased research in Data Science and Machine Learning, providing a forum for presenting and discussing the latest research and developments. Built on this tradition, AusDM25 will facilitate the cross-disciplinary exchange of ideas, experience and potential research directions. Speciﬁcally, the conference seeks to showcase: Research Prototypes; Industry Case Studies; Practical Technology; and Research Student Projects. AusDM25 will be a meeting place for pushing forward the frontiers of Data Science and Machine Learning in academia and industry. The theme of the conference this year is **Entering a new world driven by Data Science and Machine Learning**.
