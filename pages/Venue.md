# Building 80/ Swanston Academic Building (SAB) – RMIT University

AusDM25 will be held at the RMIT University Building 80 at the cosmopolitan heart of the “world’s most liveable city: Melbourne”.

The building incorporates a range of environmentally sustainable features resulting in it achieving a Green Building Council of Australia 5-star Green Star Education Design rating.

The design approach to the building sought to locate it in dialogue with surrounding architecture, both in form and colour, resulting in a striking façade and interior that is uniquely Melbourne.
