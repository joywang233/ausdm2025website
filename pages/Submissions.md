All submissions are required to follow the format specified for papers in the Springer Communications in Computer and Information Science (CCIS) style. Authors should consult [Springer’s Instructions for Authors of Proceedings](https://resource-cms.springernature.com/springer-cms/rest/v1/content/19242230/data/v13) and use either the LaTeX or the Word templates provided on the [author’s page](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines), for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in their papers.

All submitted papers must not be previously published or accepted for publication anywhere. They must not be submitted to any other conference or journal during the review process of AusDM25. We would like to draw the authors’ attention to Springer’s [Code of Conduct](https://www.springernature.com/gp/authors/book-authors-code-of-conduct) (available as a PDF [here](https://bpb-ap-se2.wpmucdn.com/blogs.auckland.ac.nz/dist/c/892/files/2022/08/Publishers_Code_of_Conduct_for_Book_Authors.pdf)). 

All submissions, except for the Industry Showcase Track, will go through a double-blind review process, i.e. paper submissions must NOT include authors names or affiliations or acknowledgments referring to funding bodies. Self-citing references should also be removed from the submitted papers for the double-blinded reviewing purpose. The information can be added in the accepted final camera-ready submissions.

The electronic submission must be in PDF only and made through the AusDM Submission link as given below.
