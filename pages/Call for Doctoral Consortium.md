# Call For Participation: AusDM25 Doctoral Consortium

The doctoral consortium (DC) of AusDM25 aims to provide Early Career Researchers (ECRs) and PhD students with the opportunity to meet, receive feedback on their research from established experts, and interact closely with their peers. Beyond valuable feedback, the consortium offers participants new contacts and great networking opportunities.

We do not expect you to have addressed all research questions, nor expect you to have completed the PhD. However, you should show an understanding of your research area and have a clear plan for addressing your research goals. This consortium is ideal for discussing your research questions with experienced researchers and fellow students to receive informed feedback.

PhDs and ECRs with an accepted paper at the main AusDM2024 conference are also encouraged to attend the DC session. The event is planned to be an in-person event in RMIT, Brisbane, Australia.

# Invited Speakers:

This year’s Doctoral Consortium offers an exceptional platform for ECRs and PhDs to engage in networking and peer learning opportunities. In conjunction with the main conference, we are pleased to announce the participation of distinguished Keynote Speakers from both academia and industry. Our esteemed guests will provide invaluable insights, sharing their journeys from Ph.D. to ECR, discussing the role of women in data science and artificial intelligence, and offering guidance on navigating a successful career in industry post-Ph.D.
