                    <h1>Call for Papers</h1>
                    <p>The <strong>Australasian Data Science and Machine Learning Conference (AusDM)</strong>, 
                        formerly known as the Australasian Data Mining Conference, has become the leading regional 
                        forum for both researchers and practitioners in Data Science and Machine Learning, including 
                        areas such as Data Mining, Data Analytics, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, 
                        and Generative AI. As these interdisciplinary fields continue to evolve, AusDM remains 
                        committed to advancing the development and application of intelligent algorithms capable of 
                        learning from large-scale, complex data. The conference plays a vital role in sharing progress 
                        and fostering collaboration within the Australasian data science community, while also showcasing 
                        breakthroughs with global relevance.</p>
