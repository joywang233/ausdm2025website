          <h1>AusDM Conference Policies</h1>

          <p>The AusDM conference series have the following set of core policies governing submissions, review, ethics, governance and attendance.</p>

          <h2>Submission Policies</h2>
          <p>Prospective authors are invited to submit papers to several tracks, commonly including a Research Track, an Application Track, and an Industry Showcase Track. Submissions for the research and application tracks require full papers with specified page limits, adhering to the Springer Communications in Computer and Information Science (CCIS) formatting guidelines. Papers must not have been previously published or be under concurrent review elsewhere.</p>

          <h2>Peer Review Process</h2>
          <p>AusDM conferences follow a rigorous double-blind peer-review process. All submissions are evaluated by a panel of international experts from the conference program committee. This process ensures anonymity for both authors and reviewers, aiming for unbiased and merit-based selection of papers.</p>

          <h2>Publication of Accepted Papers</h2>
          <p>Accepted papers from the research and application tracks are published in Springer's Communications in Computer and Information Science (CCIS) series. This provides authors with a recognised and indexed publication outlet.</p>

          <h2>Ethics and Integrity</h2>
          <p>AusDM conference series adheres to the highest ethical standards. Publication policy follows COPE guidelines and Springer's Editorial Policies. These include specific guidelines related to the transparent use and acknowledgment of Artificial Intelligence, including the AI Authorship, Generative AI Images and AI Use by Peer Reviewers.</p>

          <h2>Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)</h2>
          <p>DEI principles are integrated in the conference planning process. Conference venues include spaces that are welcoming and accessible to all participants. The conference strategically fosters diverse innovation and collaboration across governance, including the formation of committees and leadership roles, networking events, and community support. Conference organisers are committed to providing a welcoming, productive and safe environment. Discrimination, harassment, or bullying in any form will not be tolerated. All participants are expected to adhere to these principles and respect the rights of others.</p>

          <h2>Attendance and Presentation</h2>
          <p>At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the conference and present their work. This ensures active participation and facilitates discussion and networking. The conference offers virtual attendance options, subject to particular circumstances.</p>

          <h2>Photography at Conference Events</h2>
          <p>Attendance at, or participation in, AusDM conference constitutes consent to the use and distribution of the attendeeâ€™s image or voice for informational, publicity, promotional and/or reporting purposes in print or electronic communications media. Photographs of copyrighted slides are for personal use only.</p>
